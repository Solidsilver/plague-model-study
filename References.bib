abstract = {The Black Death pandemic swept through Europe during the Middle Ages leading to high mortality from plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. How it spread, the transmission of the disease within and between cities, remains a subject of controversy among scientists and historians. Prior to the identification of the bacterium in medieval tooth samples, the nature of the pandemic led to speculation that the Black Death was not the same disease as current-day plague. In the classical mode of transmission to humans, black rats act as an intermediate host and the disease spreads by infected rat fleas. But in the case of Black Death, alternate modes have been proposed in which the disease spreads either through pneumonic transmission of plague or through an intermediate human ectoparasite vector, such as the human body louse. To understand the transmission dynamics within cities, we used a spatial metapopulation model with SIR-dynamics for three transmission scenarios and compared how the epidemic curve, epidemic duration, and total mortality differ between each mode and historical data. Here we show that 1) a model of louse-borne transmission of bubonic plague fits the pattern of plague transmission within cities during the Black Death with regards to epidemic duration and the distribution of deaths during an epidemic, and that 2) primary pneumonic plague can produce large scale epidemics, but only under conditions highly favorable for this mode of transmission. These results demonstrate that the louse-borne transmission of bubonic plague is a viable alternative to resolve the inconsistencies between plague during the Black Death and plague with rats. We anticipate that the models and parameters we have presented can be used in future work for more complex models that combine multiple transmission routes. For example, a model with both primary pneumonic and bubonic plague transmission during the same epidemic. Furthermore, the models can be adapted to explore the impact of immunity, public health measures, and seasonality on the disease dynamics.},

abstract = {The basic reproduction number ℛ0 is arguably the most important quantity in infectious disease epidemiology. The next-generation matrix (NGM) is the natural basis for the definition and calculation of ℛ0 where finitely many different categories of individuals are recognized. We clear up confusion that has been around in the literature concerning the construction of this matrix, specifically for the most frequently used so-called compartmental models. We present a detailed easy recipe for the construction of the NGM from basic ingredients derived directly from the specifications of the model. We show that two related matrices exist which we define to be the NGM with large domain and the NGM with small domain. The three matrices together reflect the range of possibilities encountered in the literature for the characterization of ℛ0. We show how they are connected and how their construction follows from the basic model ingredients, and establish that they have the same non-zero eigenvalues, the largest of wh...},

Since 1997, students have developed and proposed their own research questions and derived their research projects from them as the keystone of the program. Because we have no control over what students are interested in, we need to introduce a suite of flexible techniques that can be applied to a broad variety of interests. In this paper we walk through examples of some of the most popular techniques at MTBI: epidemiological or contagion modeling and reproductive number analysis. We include an overview of the next generation matrix method of finding the basic reproductive number, sensitivity analysis as a technique for investigating the effect of parameters on the reproductive number, and recommendations for interpreting the results. Lastly we provide some advice to mentors who are looking to advise student-led research projects. All examples are taken from real student projects that students can access through the MTBI website.},

abstract = {A precise definition of the basic reproduction number, R0, is presented for a general compartmental disease transmission model based on a system of ordinary differential equations. It is shown that, if R0{\textless}1, then the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable; whereas if R0{\textgreater}1, then it is unstable. Thus, R0 is a threshold parameter for the model. An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for R0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of R0, is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector–host models and can be applied to more complex models. The results are significant for disease control.},
